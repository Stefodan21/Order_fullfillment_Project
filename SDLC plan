✅ Exposes Order Processing as a Service

Clients (e.g., a web frontend or another system) can send requests to process orders.

Enables external integrations (e.g., third-party shipping systems, dashboards).

✅ Standardized Data Exchange

Uses JSON-based requests & responses to structure order details.

Allows other applications (like mobile apps or warehouses) to access fulfillment data.

✅ Automates Order Validation & Tracking

APIs can handle requests like:

POST /validate-order → Validate incoming order requests.

GET /track-status?order_id=123 → Check fulfillment progress.

✅ Enhances Scalability with Serverless Functions

APIs can trigger AWS Lambda functions for real-time order processing and shipping suggestions.

Efficiently handles requests without maintaining servers.

✅ Improves CI/CD & Deployment Automation

REST APIs allow microservices or workflows to interact seamlessly during automated deployments.
